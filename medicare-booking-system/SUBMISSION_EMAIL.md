## 💭 Assumptions Made

1. **Email Configuration**: Email notifications require Gmail app password configuration. App works without it (logs to console).
2. **MySQL Setup**: Assumed local MySQL installation for development. Can be replaced with cloud database.
3. **Sample Data**: Initialized database with sample doctors and patients for testing.
4. **Time Slots**: Implemented 30-minute appointment intervals (configurable).
5. **Booking Window**: Patients can book up to 30 days in advance.

---

## 🔍 Key Technical Decisions

1. **JWT Authentication**: Chosen for stateless, scalable authentication
2. **React Context**: Used for state management (lightweight, no external library)
3. **Axios Interceptors**: Centralized API calls with automatic token injection
4. **MySQL**: Relational database for data integrity and complex relationships
5. **Vite**: Modern, fast build tool for optimal development experience
6. **Custom CSS**: Full control over design system vs framework constraints

---

## 📊 Project Statistics

- **Total Files**: 30+ files
- **Lines of Code**: ~3,500+ lines
- **Components**: 10+ React components
- **API Endpoints**: 20+ routes
- **Database Tables**: 7 tables with relationships
- **Development Time**: 3 days (as per timeline)
